# anilistcmp

A small website that compares and presents overlapping items between two people's anilist profiles.

This was made with the intention of helping people find something to watch together.

This is running at https://anilist.abstractumbra.dev/, you must provide two usernames within the path to query, like so:
https://anilist.abstractumbra.dev/AbstractUmbra/OtherUmbra
